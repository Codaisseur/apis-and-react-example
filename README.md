# APIs and React

This is the example implementation of day 7 of the Intermediate Bootcamp working on an Express API and a React/Redux frontend. 

There is a branch for every step in the reader:

* products-api
* redux-e-commerce
* extend-products-api
* more-react

The master branch is equal to the final product.
